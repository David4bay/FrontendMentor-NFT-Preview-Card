## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I started by removing default padding and margins on every element and pseudoelement using the universal selector, then applied a min-height of 100vh so the page could extend outwards if it required it. 
I used Microsoft Paint to obtain the width, height and padding of each element then created the main element as the parent element that will house the card body element.

After creating the nft-card body, I used flexbox to position each element to the positions specified in the mockup.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was a very good challenge, I learnt how to position elements using absolute positioning to display on hover, using z-indexes and opacity.

### Continued development

Added 0.4s transition of some elements so they ease into the screen well.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - This was the font used for this project.
- [MDN Docs CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - A good primer on css animation.
